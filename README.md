# Deep_Learning
Here I will be Teaching you all the concepts of Deep Learning in a systematic order. I have divided Deep Learning in to a few chapters and the best part is there are practice labs you must do after completion of the concepts of respective chapters. Share this repository with your friends who are interested to learn DL
<br><br><h1>Chapter 1: Intro to Neural Networks</h1>
<p>This chapter introduces Deep Learning, Neural Networks, and their applications. You will go through the theoretical background and characteristics that they share with other machine learning algorithms, as well as characteristics that make them stand out as great modeling techniques for specific scenarios. You will also gain some hands-on practice on Neural Networks and key concepts that help these algorithms converge to robust solutions.</p>
<br><br><h1>Chapter 2: Back Propagation Training and Keras</h1>
<p>In this chapter, you will learn about the maths behind the popular Back Propagation algorithm used to optimize neural networks. In the Back Propagation notebook, you will also see and understand the use of activation functions. The main purpose of most activation function is to introduce non-linearity in the network so it would be capable of learning more complex patterns. Last, but not least, you will learn to use functions and APIs from the Keras library to solve tasks that involve neural networks, and these tasks start with loading images.</p>
